README     - This file

Makefile   - makes executables: ctest, evdisp, plotraw

GHbase.C   - generated by ROOT from the tree: raw->MakeClass
GHbase.h     contains basic code to access the tree for analysis

Anal.C     - skeleton analysis derived from GHbase.  Intended to add
Anal.h       standard histogrammes etc.

CellGeom.C - class to handle Geiger Cell (x,y) lookup.  Initialises ideal
CellGeom.h   geometry followed by setting of individual channel data from
             and optional calibration file.

drawTracks.C - macro to draw track EasyTrack fits on ntsh canvases. Useful for
               avoiding tedious command repetition.

ntsh.C     - new display program, adapated from original evdisp and now
ntsh.h       based on GHbase to access data from ROOT file.
             Click on hits to highlight and dump data.
             Option to rotate the views to the commissioning orientation.
             Option to display wire positions in X-Y view.  ** UPDATED **

EasyTrack.C - simple straight line fitter in X-Y and X-Z views.
              Uses all hits to make a single track at present, no attempt to
              distinguish multiple track events yet.

loadntsh.C - run this macro to load needed libraries and startup an ntsh
             instance.

loadfit.C  - as above plus loads and runs an EasyTrack instance.  Draws fitted
             tracks using drawTracks.C

makeplots.C - macro to create PDF file of plots created by Plots.C
              just do:  root -b -q makeplots.C

mapping_anode_only.h - hideous code to convert from DAQ address to physical
                       address. Used by Unpack.cc

Plots.C    - class to make standard plots, derived from GHbase.
Plots.h

plotraw.cc - source for the program that creates the ROOT tree.
             takes ascii (simulated) raw data file as input.
             creates nothings.root
             Updated for changes agreed at a meeting on 17/4/2015 at IC.
             Modified definition of TRIGCONF card to specify Stop-A in
             nanoseconds (4 Hex digits) as first parameter.
             Added CSMAP card to specify readout to detector mapping.

raderr.C   - macro to return standard error on input drift radius in cm.
             this is defined as a simple parameterisation of difference in
             radius per anode TDC count / sqrt(12)  using the default drift
             relation currently simulated.

To use macros above in ROOT do, e.g.

bash$ root loadntsh.C
 ...starts up, draws first event.
 The created ntsh instance is called dis, i.e. you can do:
 dis.next();
 dis.show(); ...etc.

Files listed below are essentially all the original code I wrote for the
unpacker and original event display with a few minor cosmetic changes.

ctest.cc
DriftModel.cc
DriftModel.h
evdisp.cc
EventViewer.cc
EventViewer.h
GeigerEvent.cc
GeigerEvent.h
RawGeigerHit.cc
RawGeigerHit.h
rawkeys.cc ********** CSMAP card added.
rawkeys.h
Unpack.cc  ********** Modified to use DAQ card,asic,channel from D0 card.
Unpack.h
UnpackingErrors.cc
UnpackingErrors.h
ViewerGui.cc
ViewerGui.h
ViewerGuiLinkDef.h
